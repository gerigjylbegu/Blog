#About
Chromixium combines the elegant simplicity of the Chromebook with the flexibility and stability of Ubuntuâ€™s Long Term Support release. 
Chromixium puts the web front and center of the user experience. 
Web and Chrome apps work straight out of the browser to connect you to all your personal, work and education networks. 
Sign into Chromium to sync all your apps and bookmarks. 
When you are offline or when you need more power, you can install any number of applications for work or play, including LibreOffice, Skype, Steam and a whole lot more. 
Security updates are installed seamlessly and effortlessly in the background and will be supplied until 2019. 
You can install Chromixium in place of any existing operating system, or alongside Windows or Linux.

This system will fit a lot of people,because it's fast, reliable and you can easly work with it.
I personally recomend this system for download.
