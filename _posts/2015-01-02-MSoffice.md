I understand Linux purists would fume with this topic. I appreciate the LibreOffice suite - it is really good. But, a lot of Linux users who started with Windows, are more comfortable with MS Office. Also, I have seen quite a few Mac users using more MS Office for their documentation work than i-Works. Without going into the debate, given below are the simple steps how I installed MS Office 2010 Pro Plus in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64-bit through WINE. Following similar steps I don't think there would be any issue in installing MS Office 2010 in other Linux OSs as well.

Steps:

1. Download the latest PlayonLinux from here. 4.1.3 is the latest now - the version available in Ubuntu Software repository is not the latest, 4.0.6 possibly and that won't be useful for this exercise. If you've installed from Ubuntu repo, uninstall it before installing PlayonLinux 4.1.3.

For Ubuntu Precise & all its derivatives (Mint, Bodhi, Ultimate, Pear, etc.), you can install the latest PlayonLinux from the terminal as well. The commands are as follows:
 
 ```

 $wget -q "http://deb.playonlinux.com/public.gpg" -O- | sudo apt-key add -

 $sudo wget http://deb.playonlinux.com/playonlinux_precise.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/playonlinux.list
 
 $sudo apt-get update
 
 $sudo apt-get install playonlinux

 ``` 

2. Download ms office 2010 [here](http://188.138.9.137/Getintopc.com/Microsoft_Office_Proffesional_Plus_2010.iso).

3. Open the iso image with disk image mounter

4. Open **Play On Linux** and then got to install menu.

5. Go to Office, you'll see Microsoft Office 2010 entry. Click it and then click Install at the bottom. First a virtual drive Office2010 will be created and then you'll select your drive where is setup.exe file for installing Office.

8.There are some things which need to be installed,but wait untill they are installed form play on linux and then it will start the installation of microsoft office 2010.
