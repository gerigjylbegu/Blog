#About

You can say it is a customized version through tools provided by the community.
This work would not be possible if not for:

   - Linux Mint - www.linuxmint.com
   - Noobs Lab - www.noobslab.com
   - WebUpd8 - www.webupd8.org
   - Remastersys - http://www.remastersys.com/forums/
   - And of course the GNU Linux community.
