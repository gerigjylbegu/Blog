#About
Fast, free and incredibly easy to use, the Ubuntu operating system powers millions of desktop PCs, laptops and servers around the world.
Ubuntu is designed to work beautifully on the latest laptops, desktops and touch screen devices, it looks incredible on high resolution screens — and with touch screen enhancements and interface refinements including individual menu bars in each application window, it’s now even easier to use.
To use Ubuntu is to fall in love with it. The desktop environment is intuitive but powerful, so you can work quickly and accomplish all you can imagine. With full support for devices with touchscreens and trackpads as well as traditional keyboards and mice, you’ll be captivated by its elegance.
Fully translated into over 40 languages, Ubuntu also includes essential assistive technologies, which are, of course, completely free.
Ubuntu comes with a set of pre-installed software, including a complete office productivity suite and more than 3,000 downloadable apps including Steam, the world’s most popular gaming platform.
