#About
The purpose of Linux Mint is to produce a modern, elegant and comfortable operating system which is both powerful and easy to use.

Linux Mint is the most popular desktop Linux distribution and the 3rd most widely used home operating system behind Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS.

Some of the reasons for the success of Linux Mint are:

 - It works out of the box, with full multimedia support and is extremely easy to use.
 - It's both free of cost and open source.
 - It's community-driven. Users are encouraged to send feedback to the project so that their ideas can be used to  improve Linux Mint.
 - Based on Debian and Ubuntu, it provides about 30,000 packages and one of the best software managers.
 - It's safe and reliable. Thanks to a conservative approach to software updates, a unique Update Manager and the     robustness of its Linux architecture, Linux Mint requires very little maintenance (no regressions, no antivirus, no anti-spyware...etc).
