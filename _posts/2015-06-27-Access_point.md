To make a wirles access point using linux includes a couple of ways.Creating a ad_hoc wirles access point won't be shown on most mobile devices. 
So the way I'm gonna show you is simple and the access point is shown on all devices.
First go to [this](https://gist.github.com/dashohoxha/5767262) webpage and download the git file.After downloading install_access_point.sh open terminal and write:

```
chmod +x Downloads/install_access_point.sh
```
./Downloads/install_access_point.sh
```

This command will install it ,now in the middle of process you should write the name of access point(ssid) ,than write the password with eight or mor characters.
To start or stop write :

```    
 service wifi_access_point start
```
 service wifi_access_point stop
```

This is all.I hope it works.
