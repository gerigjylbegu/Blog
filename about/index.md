I am a web focused developer mostly working using Linux. Occasionally, I end up working on non web related projects.
This is my personal website and blog where I put down my thoughts, solutions to problems and learning notes.

## Linux

Linux is an open source operating system.It is fast and secure.Linux has no viruses,because all applications which can be installed are at linux software center.

## About this Site

This is a static site powered by Github. The design was done by me and the theme is freely available on [Github](https://github.com/olakara/JekyllMetro). 
Technicals apart, this is my personal site where I plan to pen down my thoughts, technical experiences that I would like to share.
